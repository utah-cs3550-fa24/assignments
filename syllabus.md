# About the Course

The goal of this class is to teach you how to develop basic web
applications, which means that by the end you will:

- understand the basic front-end and back-end architecture of web applications
- understand how to write HTML and style it with CSS
- understand how to write back-ends using a model-view-controller framework
- understand how to deploy web applications to the cloud
- understand how to set up authentication, authorization, and user roles

This course uses specific popular technologies (Linux, Python, Django,
Sqlite, Bootstrap, jQuery, AWS) but the skills you gain are intended
to apply more generally.

This course is a basic introduction to web development. It builds a
foundation for other professional web development skills taught in CS
3540, CS 4550, CS 4560, and CS 6450.

# Cost

This course will require you to deploy your web application to a cloud
service. This will require the purchase of a domain. The specific
domain will be up to you, and acceptable domains can be purchased for
under $10. Contact the instructors if this charge will be a problem
for you. Additionally, misuse or misconfiguration of the cloud service
may incur charges. We will teach you what steps are required to avoid
charges. Follow those steps diligently.

# Assessment

Your grade will use the [standard 90/80/70/60 scale][grade], but the
instructors reserve the option to curve any grade component if they
judge that it was more difficult than intended. The grade components
are:

| Component                | Weight           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Homework (7 assignments) | 56% (so 8% each) |
| Midterm                  | 22%              |
| Final                    | 22%              |

The assignments are cumulative: by the end of the course, you'll have
written a small "full-stack" web application. Assignments are due
Friday at the end of the day and must be submitted over Github.
However, a two-day extension is automatically granted (without any
grading penalty). Assignments later than that won't be accepted; with
cumulative assignments it is imperative that you do not fall behind.

The midterm will be during class time on 2 October, just before fall
break, and will cover all material from the first half of the class.
The final will be on December 9 at 6pm, and will be cumulative. Both
take place in the normal classroom.

# Class Time

This is an in-person class. Your attendance is assumed. Classes will
not be recorded, neither in general nor due to absence. (Feel free to
arrange that on your own with friends.)

Disruptive, belittling, or rude behavior will not be tolerated,
including online. Remember: everyone in this class is here to learn.
If you already know the material, take a different class.

# Getting Help

Getting help early is the best way to succeed in this course. There
are three ways to get help in this course:

You can ask questions on Piazza. This will typically get you the
fastest responses, especially since other students can help you out.
Naturally, don't post your homework solutions, but short snippets that
you're struggling with are fine.

You can ask questions after class. This is a good way to get answers
to quick questions about your grade or assignment.

You can go to office hours. Office hours are by appointment; use the
link at the top of this syllabus. You will have the TA's undivided
attention during office hours, so this is a great way to get debugging
help or ask larger conceptual questions

Do not wait to get help. It's much easier to not fall behind than it
is to catch up!

# Schedule

# Policies

**Cheating**. CS 3550 will follow the School of Computing’s cheating
policy. Basically, it's OK to discuss the assignment or your approach
with other students at a high level, but it is not OK to share code or
look at another student's code, or similar code found online. Academic
dishonesty results in a failing grade for the course, and two
instances of academic dishonestly lead to expulsion from the major.

**Rounding**. Grades that end in ".9" will be rounded up to the next
whole number.

**AI**. You must not use AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and so
on) for any code you submit for an assignment. In an introductory
class like this, they work too well, to the extent that they'll keep
you from learning skills you'll need in later classes or your career.
That said, you are free to use AI tools for other purposes, like
helping debug problems, answering general questions about web
technologies, or providing examples of how to use an API.

**Changes**. The syllabus can be changed with reasonable in-class
notice by the instructor.

Please also familiarize yourself with [University policies][u-policy]
on the ADA, safety, sexual misconduct, Covid, undocumented students,
drop/withdrawal, student mental health, student support, and academic
misconduct, as well as the [Kahlert School of Computing's academic
policies][ksoc-policy] and the [College of Engineering policies][coe-policy].
