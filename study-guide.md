Study Guide
===========

This document lists vocabulary, concepts, and syntax that you're
expected to know for the midterm and final. You should use this
document to study outside of class.

HTML
----

**Basic HTML**: You should be able to use HTML to:

- Write valid HTML using the doctype, `<meta>`, `<link>`, `<title>`
- Style text using `<a>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<code>`, `<img>`
- Structuring text using `<p>`, `<h1>` through `<h6>`, `<pre>`
- Structure pages using `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`
- Separate sections with `<section>`, `<aside>`
- Write lists using `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<menu>`, `<li>`
- Write tables using `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tfoot>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>`
- Use `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;` escapes and `<!-- -->` comments

You should be able to look at a screenshot of a website or application
and write valid, semantically-meaningful HTML for it using standard
tags.

**Accessibility**: You should know key accessibility requirements,
such as proper heading hierarchies, textual alternatives for images,
and language attributes. You should be able to identify when HTML code
is missing these accessiblity requirements. You should know the
`lang`, `alt`, and `title` attributes, and the `<label>` element. For
`<input>` elements, you should know the `checkbox`, `radio`, `file`,
`image`, `date`, `time`, `text`, `number`, `email`, and `tel` types.

CSS
---

**Basic CSS**: You should be able to write CSS code that uses tag, ID,
and class selectors, plus the `:hover` pseudo-class, and compound
selectors using the space combination type. You should be able to
write selectors to select various elements on an HTML page.

You should know the following CSS properties:

- `font-family`, `font-weight`, `font-style`, `font-size`, and
  `text-decoration`
- `color`, `background-color`, and `opacity`
- `border` (the three-value form) and its subproperties like
  `border-bottom` or `border-left-width`
- `border-radius` (the one-value form)

You should be able to explain the cascading rule, inheritance, and
shorthand properties.

**Legacy layout**: You should be able to identify where the padding,
margin, and border areas of a box are. You should be able to define
inline and block layout mode. You should be able to write a
`max-width` or `min-width` media query.

You should be able to use the following types of values:

- For lengths, the `px`, `rem`, `vw`, and `vh` units

- For `line-height`, numeric multipliers
- The CSS named fonts `serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospace`

**Flex-box**: You should be able to create complex layouts using
flex-box layout, including nested layouts with rows and columns. This
involves knowing how to use the the `display: flex` and
`flex-direction` properties, the `width`/`height`, `flex-grow`, and
`flex-shrink` properties, and the `justify-content`, `gap`, and
`align-items` properties.

Knowing the properties and their values is not enough! You should be
able to design complex layouts using flex-box, starting from
screenshots or wireframes. The [Notes](notes.md#flex-box) have a short
checklist you can follow to build complex flex-box layouts. You should
feel comfortable using this checklist to create layouts from
screenshots or wireframes. It is important to practice this.

`forloop.counter0` variables.

**Controllers**: You should know the syntax for defining URLs,
including parameterized URLs, in `urls.py`.

You should be able to query, create, and save Django model objects.
Specifically, you should know the following query operators:

- `filter`, `exclude`, `union`, `intersection`, and `distinct`
- `order_by` and `reverse`
- `count` and `aggregate`
- `first` and `last`
- `contains` and `exists`

You should be able to use to query objects by field (as in
`author="Tom Clancy"`; by field of a related object (as in
`author_name="Tom Clancy"`); or by property of a field (as in
`author_name__contains="Tom"`).

You should be able to explain the "1 + N" problem and be able to use
`select_related` to fix it.

You should be able to explain migrations, when they are created, when
they are run, and what problem they solve.

Topics below this line are not on the midterm, even if they were
covered in class before the midterm was assessed.

----------------------------------------------------

Forms
=====

**Forms** You should know how to make a valid HTML form, including the
`<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, and `<output`> elements.
You should know what the `action`, `method`, and `enctype` parameters
do on forms, and be able explain the difference between the `get` and
`post` values for `method` and choose the right one for various forms.
(You are not expected to know what values to put for `enctype`, but
you are expected to know in what case you need to set a non-default
`enctype`.) You should know the `type`, `id`, `name`, `value`, and
`disabled` attributes on input elements.

You should be able to write a Django view function (controller) that
receives form data and saves it to the database. You should know how
to use the `request.GET`, `request.POST`, and `request.FILES`
dictionaries to access form data. You should be able to describe the
risks associated with file uploads.

**Validation**: You should know how to catch `DoesNotExist` errors
from queries and return `Http404` errors. You should know how to
catch `ValueError`s from parsing numbers. You should be able to write
a form handler that re-renders on failure and redirects on success,
and where the re-rendering uses some errors data structures.

You should be able to use the following input element attributes for
client-side validation:

- `required`
- `min` / `max`
- `minlength` / `maxlength`
