CS 3550 Assignment 1 (HTML)
===========================

**Status**: Final \
**Due**: Phase 1 due **23 Aug**. Phase 2--5 due **30 Aug**.

In this assignment, you will set up a web server and write initial
HTML pages for the grading application that you'll build all semester.
Specifically, in this assignment, you will demonstrate that you can:

- Configure and start a basic web server using Django
- Create basic web pages with data/content marked up using HTML
- Use common HTML structural, textual, and media elements
- Use common HTML element attributes for those elements

The assignment is due Friday, 30 August, before midnight. The course's
normal extension policy applies. Hand in your finished assignment by
pushing it to your repository on Github.

This assignment is intended take 6--8 hours and must be done solo. If
you've been working on it for longer than that and feel stuck, get
help on Discord or sign up for an office hours slot.

All code you turn in must be yours. This includes copying code from
sources on the internet, *including the source code of live websites*
or code generated by AI tools. You may discuss, plan, and confer with
your peers about the broad strokes of how to do this assignment, or
ask their help debugging your code. However, any peers you do confer
with must be listed on the assignment cover sheet.

Phase 1: Starting the web server
--------------------------------

First, [install all of the required software](install.md) and make
sure all the indicated commands work.

Second, check out your Github repository. You will do all of your
coding for this class inside this folder.

Third, run the following set of commands:

    cd <path>
    python3 -m django startproject cs3550 .

In the first command, replace `<path>` with whatever path is necessary
to get to the Git repository. The second command creates a Django
"project" called `cs3550` and puts it in the current directory.

Test that this worked by running:

    python3 manage.py runserver

This should print some messages, ending with the line "Quit the server
with CONTROL-C". Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/;
you should see a page informing you that "The install worked
successfully! Congratulations!" You can now press `Ctrl+C` in the
terminal to stop the server.

*MacOS users*: In some cases, depending on where you've put these
files, you may see errors from "Watchman". Usually this means you need
to press "yes" some some permissions dialogs that have popped up, but
if the error persists, you can add `--noreload` to the `runserver`
command. This disables Watchman, but the cost is that you may need to
terminate and restart the server process every time you change your
application.

If at any point in these steps you get what looks like an error
message, ask for help.

Fifth, edit the file `cs3550/settings.py` inside your repository. Find
the line that starts with `STATIC_URL` and add the following line
below it:

    STATICFILES_DIRS = [ 'static/' ]

Create a directory called `static` inside your repository. Your
repository should now contain the following files and folders:

- A folder `cs3550`, which in turn contains `settings.py`, `urls.py`,
  `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py`, and `__init__.py`. It might also contain a
  `__pycache__` directory, which is auto-generated by Python.
- A file `manage.py`, which you use ran above
- An empty folder `static`
- Possibly a file called `db.sqlite3`

Sixth, create the file `.gitignore` in the root of your repository.
Add the following contents:

    uploads/*
    db.sqlite3
    *.pyc
    .DS_Store
    autotester

This makes sure you don't commit any autogenerated files to Github.

Seventh, create a file `test.html` in the `static` directory. Add the
following contents:

    <!doctype html>
    The test worked.

Test that this all worked by running:

    python3 manage.py runserver

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/static/test.html

You should see the words "The test worked." on your screen. If you do,
commit everything to Github; Phase 1 is done. If you do not, get help.



Phase 2: Writing the page header
--------------------------------

Over the next two phases, we'll be writing the "Assignment" page for
your grading application. In the final version of the application, the
one you'll have at the end of the class, it will look like this:

![A screenshot of an "assignment" page](screenshots/assignment.png)

Of course, that's _not_ what the page will look like at the end of
this assignment. In fact, since you won't be writing any CSS at all in
this assignment, the page will look plain and unstyled, very different
from the screenshot above.

You task is to write valid and semantic HTML that reflects the
*content* of that screenshot, even though it won't copy its
*appearance*. You'll be graded on schooling appropriate HTML tags that
reflect the content's meaning and organization without encoding any
purely stylistic elements.

To start writing the HTML, create the file `index.html` in the
`static` directory. In this file, you can write HTML code, and the web
page defined by that HTML code will show up when you start the server
(by executing the `runserver` command again) and go to
http://localhost:8000/static/index.html in your browser.

Start by setting up a basic HTML page: the `doctype`, `charset`
declaration, and `<title>` tag. Set the tab name to "Assignment 1
(HTML) - CS 3550" and set the tab icon to the [application
icon](resources/favicon.ico). You can download that application icon
by clicking the link. Place it in your `static/` folder, and refer to
it as `/static/favicon.ico` from your HTML code.

Look at the screenshot at the beginning of this section. At the top of
the screenshot, there is a gray "navigation bar", containing the words
"CS 3550 Assignments Profile". In this phase, you must write HTML for
this navigation bar. Make "Assignments" link to `assignments.html` and
"Profile" link to `profile.html`. (This way the links will all work
when you add more pages later.) "CS 3550" does not need to be
clickable.

Remember that your HTML will have the contents and meaning, but not
the appearance, from the screenshot. Use valid, semantic markup,
including the elements we covered in class (you can find a list in the
[study guide](study-guide.md)). Ask yourself questions like:

- What's the role this navigation bar, and the various pieces of it,
  play on this page? Is it part specific to this page, or to all the
  pages on this site?
- How do different words relate to each other? Are they a paragraph of
  text, or are they list elements, or headings and subheadings?
- Are they interactive? Does clicking on each one take you to a new
  page, or does it perform some action?
- If something were removed from the page, would I understand the web
  page differently (in which case that something is content and should
  be in the HTML) or would it just look different (in which case that
  something is styling and shouldn't be in the HTML).

These, and other questions like it, will help you select the
appropriate HTML tags to use and decide which aspects of the page the
HTML needs to reflect.



Phase 3: The rest of the assignments page
-----------------------------------------

Copy your `index.html` file to a new file, `assignment.html`. Close
`index.html` (we'll return to it shortly) and open the new
`assignment.html` page. This file should already contain the page
header, and now we'll add the rest of the assignment page, including
the "Homework 1 (HTML)" title, the blue "action box", the assignment
description, and [the image](screenshots/assignment.png), which like
the favicon you can download into your `static/` directory and refer
to as `/static/assignment.png`.

As you work on this web page, make sure to write valid, well-indented,
and easy-to-read HTML code. Use appropriate structural elements,
including `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>` for the main areas of the
page; `<em>`, `<strong>`, and `<code>` for inline text markup; `<h1>`,
`<h2>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, and `<p>` tags for text structure; and `<a>`
and `<img>` tags for links and images. Include all required
attributes, such as `href` for `<a>` tags and `src` for `<img>` tags.

You do *not* need to explicitly write the `<html>`, `<head>`, or
`<body>` element, or write closing tags if they are optional. Nor do
you need the closing slash on void elements like `<img>`.

Continue to ask the questions listed in the previous phase to
determine which parts of the page are content and which are style. In
some cases, there may not be any appropriate HTML tag, in which case
you might use `<div>` or `<span>`. But before you do that,
double-check the list of tags in the [study guide](study-guide.md) to
make sure there isn't an appropriate semantic tag.

If you make mistakes, you can use the browser developer tools to
understand how your browser is interpreting your HTML code and why the
page looks the way it does.

Once you're done, look at the page in your browser and make sure it
has the same meaning as the screenshot, even though it looks
different. Once you're satisfied, move on the Phase 4.



Phase 4: Creating more pages
----------------------------

Make three more copies of `index.html`: `submissions.html`,
`profile.html`, and `login.html` pages. Each of these pages---and
`index.html`---now need content. Here are what these four pages should
look like:

|                                                       |                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| ![The assignments page](screenshots/assignments.png) | ![The submissions page](screenshots/submissions.png) |
| ![The profile page](screenshots/profile.png)         | ![The login page](screenshots/login.png)             |

In each case, you're building the "TA view". Later on in the class,
you'll add support for both students and TAs and different users will
then see different content.

Write HTML for each view. Make sure that:

- Each page should use the same HTML for the navigation bar
- Each page should set an appropriate tab title and set the tab icon
- Each table must use proper HTML for tables, including `<table>`,
  `<tr>`, and `<td>` elements. When necessary, tables should use
  `<thead>`, `<tfoot>`, and `<th>` elements to mark header and footer
  rows. Each row in the table should represent the same kind of
  object---don't use tables just to create a 2D layout.
- Input elements should use `<label>`, `<input>`, and `<button>`. Make
  sure to pick the right `type` for each `<input>` element and the
  right `for` for each `<label>` element. Each input element, label,
  or button must go in a `<form>` element, which should contain all
  related inputs. Note that different browsers display the same input
  elements differently. Think about the *meaning* of the input element
  instead of trying to exactly reflect its *appearance*.
- Make sure all links work, except the "Submission" links on the
  submissions page. You should be able to click on all other links and
  go to another one of the pages you have created.

As in Phase 2, make sure to write valid, well-indented, and
easy-to-read HTML code. Make use of the browser developer tools or an
HTML validator to understand and correct problems.



Phase 5: Improving accessibility
--------------------------------

Let's now make a variety of tweaks to the pages you've developed to
make them more accessible.

**First**, let's make the page easier to use from the keyboard. Go to the
"login" page and press the `Tab` key on your computer. This will move
you from one thing on the page to another. Make sure doing this goes
through the fields in the order username, password, login button.

Also, pretty much any time anyone shows up on this page, they'll be
using the form, so use the `autofocus` attribute to make it so the
user can immediately type into the username box when they load the
page.

**Second**, let's make sure any images on the page have textual
descriptions. Screen-readers can read these descriptions to blind
users.

Add an `alt` attribute to the assignment image. Make sure to describe
the useful contents of that image---basically imagine if there was a
paragraph of text instead of an image, and then write that paragraph.

Make sure every `<input>` element has a `<label>` associated with it.
On the `submissions.html` page, there's no room for a label; in this
case, add a `title` to the `<input>` element. Make sure the title
contains all the information someone would need to know what to type
into the input element.

**Third**, let's make sure links have useful content.

Look over all of the links and buttons on all of the pages. Add
`title` attributes where necessary. You don't need `title` attributes
for most links: the "Assignments" link doesn't need a `title` reading
"Go to the Assignments page", because that's already clear from the
content of the link. But if the target of a link or the meaning of an
input element relies on information *outside* that link or input
element, then that information should be in a label, `alt`, or `title`
attribute.

**Finally**, take a look at the "Log out" button on the `profile.html`
page. This link actually performs an action, so give it the `button`
role.



Write a cover sheet
-------------------

Rerun `python3 manage.py runserver` and confirm that every page looks
as expected. Also confirm that all of the links work and that all of
the HTML source code is readable. If you find any problems, use the
browser developer tools or an HTML validator to understand and correct
the problem.

Once you are sure everything works correctly, copy-and-paste the
following text into a new empty text file called "HW1.md" located
directly in your repository (not in the `static/` folder):

```
Homework 1 Cover Sheet
----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [ ] Phase 1
- [ ] Phase 2
- [ ] Phase 3
- [ ] Phase 4
- [ ] Phase 5

I discussed this assignment with:

- ...

- ...

[ ] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was ...

The hardest thing in this assignment was ...
```

In the first list, replace `[ ]` with `[x]` for each phase of the
assignment you completed.

In the second list, replace the `...`s with the names of all other
persons (student, friend, family, online stranger) that you discussed
this assignment with.

In the oath below that, check the box. Recall that, while you may
discuss the assignment in broad strokes, you must write every line of
code submitted by you, as stated in the oath below this list. This
includes the use of AI tools such as ChatGPT.

In the last two paragraphs, replace the `...` with the most
interesting and the most difficult aspect of this assignment. Don't
just make them a few words; write in full sentences. The instructors
use your answers to make these assignments more interesting and
easier.



How you will use this
---------------------

You typically start writing a web application by writing the HTML, and
it's typical to start with a screenshot produced by, say, a designer.
Writing valid, semantic HTML is important because it helps with
styling, search engine results, and accessibility.

We'll shortly write CSS code that adjust how each HTML element looks
so that your HTML looks like the screenshots you were working off of.

In a real-world website, much of the HTML is generated
programmatically based on data in a databse. For example, the rows in
the table of assignments would be generated by a `for` loop, where
each iteration of the loop generates one row. You will write this kind
of programmatic HTML generation in HW3.

Finally, accessibility is important in almost all real-world websites.
Besides helping people with disabilities (which may well be you,
perhaps when you get older---think of your older relatives),
techniques like tab order and `alt` text also help non-disabled users
as well. For example, if you set up your `<label>` elements correctly,
clicking on a label should allow you to type into the associated input
field, while appropriate `alt` text helps search engines recommend
your page if it has relevant images.



Grading Rubric
--------------

This assignment is worth 100 points. The different phases are worth
different weights:

**Phase 1** is worth 10 points. It is graded on:

- Your repository must contain a Django project named `cs3550`
- Your web server must start and respond to requests on `localhost`
- Your web server must successfully show the test page at
  http://localhost:8000/static/test.html
  
If you pass all auto-tests up to and including "Checking that
`/static/test.html` exists", then you have completed this phase.

Note that if you don't complete this phase, it is impossible to grade
most of the others, so you won't receive a passing grade.

**Phase 2** is worth 15 points. It is graded on:

- All of the required content must be present.
- The appropriate structural HTML elements must be used.
- The links should work.
- No HTML should be present for unnecessary stylistic content.

**Phase 3** is worth 20 points. It is graded on:

- All of the required content must be present.
- The appropriate structural HTML elements must be used for the
  various parts of the page.
- The appropriate textual elements must be used for all of the
  formatted text.
- Complex HTML like lists and headings should be marked up correctly.
- The appropriate HTML attributes must be used where required.
- No HTML should be present for unnecessary stylistic content.

**Phase 4** is worth 40 points. Is is graded on:

- All of the required views must exist.
- Each view must contain all of the required content.
- Each view must use appropriate HTML elements.
- Complex HTML like tables and forms must be marked up correctly.
- Each view must set the appropriate HTML attributes where required.
- All links on each view must work and go to the appropriate other view.

**Phase 5** is worth 10 points. It is graded on:

- Tab order and autofocus must be set correctly.
- All images, links, and input elements must have appropriate
  descriptions.
- The `button` role must be set for the "Log out" link.

**Cover Sheet** is worth 5 points. It is graded on:

- Cover sheet is formatted correctly.
- All questions on the cover sheet have coherent answers.

Note that if your cover sheet does not list all people you discussed
the assignment with, or misrepresents others' work as your own, that
is academic misconduct and can result in severe sanctions beyond the 5
points the cover sheet is worth. In the most severe cases, the
sanction for academic misconduct is failing this course.
